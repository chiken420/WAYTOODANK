<h1>PC Components<h1>
      <h1>Random Access Memory (RAM)<h1>
<img src="ram.png" class="w3-round" alt="Norway" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2>
Random Access Memory, also known as RAM, is a type of hardware inside tons of different devices like your phone and computer. It is used as flash-storage, which is pretty much temporary storage, to store some working part of the operating system temporarily, and it will do the same with data from applications that are currently active.
Functionality of RAM
Because of its volatility, RAM is unable to premanent information. Its short-term memory is focused on one thing, the work that is currently being processed by the computer. It can only keep certain information for a certain amount of time. If the RAM is to get dull, the CPU, something of which we will get into later, will go to the hard disk, something which we will also get into later, repeatedly.
</h2>
<br>
          <h1>Central Proessing Unit (CPU)<h1>
<img src="cpu.png" class="w3-round" alt="Norway" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2> You could say that the CPU is the brain of the operation, running everything on your device.  The CPU is one of many units that process information, but it is one of the more important one. It is the unit that does most of the calculations, actions and, of course, run programs. It works by gaining information from the RAM, which is represented as a series of numbers to the CPU, and the current instruction address gets held by a program counter, which just contains the origin point (address) of the instruction currently getting executed. The program counter (PC) and some instructions are then sent to an instruction register (IR), which is part of the unit that controls the CPU and holds the information that is currently being executed or decoded. Once an instructed has been received and stores in the IR, the CPU will get to work and start passing it to a circuit called the instruction decoder. I think it speaks for itself about what it does. It conveys the information into signals which then get passed onto other parts of the CPU for further action. Once this has all finished, the result is most of the time written to a CPU register, which the CPU can use to be referenced by instructions later. Pretty much its own memory.
</h2>
          <h1>Network Card<h1>
          <img src="networkcard.png" alt="Network Card" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2> A network card is a component that gives a device access to such stuff as the internet. It can have a wired connection (such as Ethernet) or a wireless connection (like Wi-Fi) to a LAN (Local Area Network). Network cards were often used in desktop computers in the 90’s and early 2000’s. In the 80’s and early 90’s, most home computers couldn’t connect to the internet, so you could add a network card to gain access to it.
As Wi-Fi became more popular, wireless network cards were made more often. This type of network card doesn’t have a ethernet port, but are instead designed for wireless connections. There are multiple types of networking standards, so it is best to match your network card to the specification your network uses. If you’re connecting to, let’s say a Gigabit ethernet network, then a Gigabit Ethernet NIC is the way to go. There is multiple different network with different speeds. And also, if you’re planning to use a wireless network card, make sure to check if it supports newer wireless standards, such as the 801.11ac, because if it can’t, you will be unable to connect to that network.
</h2>

          <h1>Power Supply (PSU)<h1>
            <img src="powersupply.png" class="w3-round" alt="Power Supply" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2>The power supply is the most important component on every device. It’s called the heart of your computer for a reason. It is this unit that gives your device life, gives it electricity. It, of course, receives power from an electrical outlet and then converts the electrical current from an alternating current to a direct current, which is what the computer needs to work. The direct current also regulates the voltage that the computer needs, which allows the computer to run smoothly without it overheating. Most computer have their power supply internally, which other devices might use external one, which is most common for computer monitors, external hard drives, external disk reader, and so on and so forth. Because it’s the component that powers everything, It is also the one that has the most vulnerability to things like power surges and spikes. But thankfully, all power supplies are designed with this In mind. Some of them got a fuse that will blow when the sudden surge is too great, protecting the rest of your equipment. It’s better and cheaper if only your power supply dies rather than everything in your computer.
</h2>

<h1> HDD & SSD <h1>
  <img src="HDDSSD.png" class="w3-round" alt="Power Supply" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2>
  Hard Disk Drive
  <br>
  <br>
This is the component that stores all the information you got on your computer. There is 2 versions of this storage device, Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD). What’s the difference? Well, the hard drive uses a stack of disks that are enclosed in a solid encasement. These disks can get up to incredible speeds, like for example 5400 Revolutions per Minute, but of course, they can go even faster than that, depending on the hard drive. The data on a hard drive is stored magnetically, so it stays there even when the power supply is turned off.
<br>
<br>
Solid State Drive (SSD)
<br>
<br>
This is also a type of mass storage device, just like the hard drive. It supports reading and writing data and it maintains the data in a permanent state even when it doesn’t have any power given to it. The SSD is similar to the hard drive, but it doesn’t have any moving parts, which the hard drive does. Instead of storing the information on magnetic platters, the SSD stores information using flash memory. Since SSD’s don’t have to get spinning when it’s “sleeping”, and it doesn’t need to move a drive head to different parts of the disc in order to access different data, which makes the SSDs capable to access data faster than an HDD.
</h2>

<h1> Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) <h1>
  <img src="gpu.webp" class="w3-round" alt="Power Supply" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2>
  This is the eyes of the operation. It is this unit that makes you able to see what you are doing on a screen. The GPU. If you got a modern CPU, a GPU might not be needed for you, because you might have one internally. A GPU is, of course, is the part of the computer that is responsible for showing you, for example, an image, an animation, and/or a video, onto your screen. A GPU performs parallel operations Although it can, and often is, used for 2D (2 dimensional) data as well as zooming and panning the screen, the GPU is, of course, essential for the smooth decoding and rendering for stuff like 3D (3 dimensional) animations and video. The more advanced the GPU is, the more capable it will be on higher resolutions and will be able to give you more frames per second, which can make your experience much smoother if you got a screen above 60hz.GPU’s on stand-alone cards got their own memory, which is called VRAM (Visual Random Access Memory), while GPUs built into the chipset or CPU chip share the main memory with the CPU.
</h2>
<h1>Motherboard<h1>
  <img src="motherboard.png" class="w3-round" alt="Power Supply" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
<h2> The motherboard is pretty much the main circuit board of your computer. If you were to open your computer, this would be the biggest component in there. On the motherboard you will find everything that makes your computer work. The CPU, RAM, USB slots, and so on. The motherboard is what makes everything inside your computer work together.
Different motherboards got different chipsets, which is the slot for the CPU. So your CPU might not be able to be used with the motherboard you’re currently using. So make sure that the CPU can be used by your current motherboard, or the one you are considering buying.
</h2>

<h1>Chassis<h1>
  <img src="chassis.png" class="w3-round" alt="Power Supply" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">
  <h2> The chassis, also known as a “System Unit” or a “Tower”, is the main part of a desktop computer. It has all components stored inside of it. It has the case that stores the internal components of the computer. </h2>
